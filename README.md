# loginsystem
Introduction:

A login system designed to understand CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) serves as a foundational component for managing user authentication and authorization within an application. CRUD operations are essential for handling user data securely and efficiently. In this context, the login system is a practical example of how these operations are implemented to facilitate user management.

Key Components:

1. **User Signup (Create):**
   - Users can create an account by providing necessary information, such as username, email, and password.
   - The system securely stores this information, typically in a database, creating a new user record.

2. **User Login (Read):**
   - The login system checks the entered credentials against the stored records during the authentication process.
   - If the provided username and password match an existing record, the user is granted access.

3. **User Logout (Logout):**
   - Authenticated users can Logout after login.
